"""
routes.py  (the actual HTTP endpoints)

/login is the ONE route with no auth dependency -- everything else
requires a valid session, resolved by api/auth_dependency.py's
get_current_user().

/login's failure is DELIBERATELY as generic as verify_credential()
itself already is -- "invalid username or password" regardless of
whether the username exists at all, same uniform-denial reasoning used
everywhere else in this project, just applied at the HTTP boundary
instead of inside core/.

/users (creating a new user) is gated by authorize(current_user, roles,
"manage:users") -- the SAME authorize() function every other RBAC
check in this project uses, not a separate "is_root" special case.
core/user_directory.create_user() itself performs no permission check
of its own; the route is responsible for checking BEFORE calling it,
same "gatekeeping stays at the boundary" pattern used throughout.

/query runs on OUR OWN explicit executor (app.state.executor, see
api/app.py's docstring) via asyncio.run_in_executor(), not Starlette's
own internal thread pool. It has THREE possible outcomes:
  - 200: a real answer, synthesized from what was gathered. If
    AgentLoop hit its max_hops limit before finishing (result.
    hit_max_hops), synthesize_insight() is told explicitly -- the
    answer itself will say so, rather than reading like a complete
    result when the search may genuinely have been cut short. See
    core/llm/synthesis_prompt.py's possibly_incomplete parameter.
  - 202 Accepted: the AI proposed a write. Nothing has happened to the
    data yet -- the response is a REFERENCE (a write_id), which
    /writes/{write_id}/confirm resolves later, in a genuinely separate
    request. 202 is the correct, standard status for exactly this
    shape ("request understood, not yet acted on, here's where to
    check"). See core/agent/agentic_loop.py's module docstring for why
    AgentLoop itself was changed to never confirm/execute a write on
    its own -- a synchronous pause for human approval mid-request has
    no meaning for a remote HTTP caller.
  - Cancelled early because the client disconnected mid-query: logged
    (log_query_cancelled), then raises a 499 (a widely-used, if
    unofficial, convention for "client closed the request") -- this
    response is never actually delivered to anyone (that's WHY it was
    cancelled), but the route still needs to return something
    well-formed rather than silently fall into logic that assumes the
    job completed normally. Disconnection is detected by a small
    concurrent watcher task polling request.is_disconnected() and
    setting a threading.Event AgentLoop.run() checks between hops --
    this does NOT stop the underlying background thread instantly
    (Python cannot safely force-kill a running thread from outside;
    confirmed against CPython's own issue tracker), only skips any
    FURTHER hops once the watcher notices -- bounded by the executor's
    fixed size and AgentLoop's own max_hops either way, so an abandoned
    job can't run unboundedly even in the worst case.

RE-VERIFICATION: a query can take a while (several LLM round-trips).
If the user's role or MAC value changes WHILE it's running (e.g. a
genuine access revocation), the results just gathered were computed
under permissions that are no longer current. Applies to BOTH the
"synthesize an answer" path AND the "return a pending write" path --
stale permissions shouldn't be acted on either way. Re-checks the
user's CURRENT record (a fast, direct database lookup, not offloaded
to the executor) against the UserRecord the job actually ran with,
using UserRecord's own dataclass equality rather than hand-rolled
field comparisons. Any mismatch refuses the whole response -- 409
Conflict, distinct from 401 (never authenticated) or 403 (never had
permission at all).

/logout-all revokes EVERY session for the calling user (self-service --
a lost device, not sure which token is compromised). /users/{username}/
logout-all does the same for an admin, targeting anyone -- gated by
manage:users, same as every other account-management action below.
Both call the SAME SessionStore.invalidate_all_sessions();
deliberately revokes ALL sessions including whichever one made the
request, not "all except this one" -- simpler, and matches the
project's "if in doubt, everyone re-authenticates" discipline.

/users/{username}/visible-schema is an admin debugging view --
DataMediator.visible_schema() already computes exactly "what can this
user see," this just exposes it for a target user instead of only ever
being used internally for the caller's own request. Lets an admin
verify a role actually grants what they think it grants, without
impersonating anyone.

/users/{username}/disable, /enable, and DELETE /users/{username} are
account lifecycle actions, all gated by manage:users. Disabling
invalidates existing sessions AND is checked fresh on every subsequent
request (see api/auth_dependency.py) -- it takes effect immediately,
not just against future logins. /login itself ALSO checks
is_user_disabled(), after the credential check, never before -- see
that route's own comment for why the ordering matters (a timing side
channel otherwise). Deletion clears the credential, the directory
entry, and every session in one atomic operation (core.user_directory.
delete_user()) -- a deleted account can never be left holding a
still-valid token. Deliberately NOT guarded against an admin disabling
or deleting their own account, or the last remaining admin -- a real,
intentionally out-of-scope simplification, not an oversight.

/writes/{write_id}/confirm is the SEPARATE, later request that actually
approves or rejects a proposed write. Looks the write up by ID AND the
confirming user's identity together (core.pending_write_store.
PendingWriteStore.pop() is uniform-denial -- wrong user, unknown ID,
and expired ID all produce the identical 404, never a distinguishing
message). Also runs on app.state.executor now, same as /query --
confirm_and_execute() stopped being "a single, already-atomic SQL
statement" once an update could span multiple storages (see
core/ontology/write_log.py's own module docstring): it can now be a
log INSERT, several sequential cross-file write_fields() calls under a
lock, and a log UPDATE, real I/O that could otherwise block the event
loop for meaningfully longer than intended.
